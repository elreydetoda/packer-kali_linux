**For those that haven't seen this before**
Just wanted to give you a little information as to what this is, if you are just viewing this for the first time.

I have created this issue because when you automate things there are sometimes you start noticing, or get affected by, things that other people screw up (because infrastructure is hard). That will then cause my automation to screw up, since I am relying on other peoples infrastructure to run this automation. 

So below you will see links/pictures as to something that might be currently stopping this project from working, and as soon as it is closed (i.e. when I notice that is fixed by the individual) then the project should be fine and worked for me. At this point you should file a regular bug, if you are having issues, so I can help you debug why I am screwing up :grin:

**Vendor**
What vendor caused the screw up?

**Describe the issue/link to bug reported to vendor**
A clear and concise description of what the problem is would be appreciated.

**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about the request here.
