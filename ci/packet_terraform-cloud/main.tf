# if you are a person that does IaC (Infrastructure as Code)
#   for a living then please don't be mad at me for not following
#   convention of breaking out this file into multiple files
#   (i.e. variables.tf and output.tf) it is easier to showcase
#   at conferences and it does very little, so that is why I have
#   it all in one "big" file.
